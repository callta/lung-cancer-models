# libsurv

## Introduction

A library of efficient survival analysis models, including `DeepCox`, `HitBoost`, `BecCox` and `EfnBoost` methods.

- `DeepCox`: Deep cox proportional hazard model implemented by tensorflow. It's exactly the same as [`TFDeepSurv`](https://github.com/liupei101/TFDeepSurv).
- `HitBoost`: Survival analysis via a multi-output gradient boosting decision tree method.
- `EfnBoost`: Optimized cox proportional hazard model via an objective function of Efron approximation.
- `BecCox`: Adding convex function approximated concordance index in `EfnBoost` to adjust risk ranking.

## Enhancement

- comprehensive document
- python package distribution

## Installation

```bash
# in the directory where `setup.py` is located
ls
# install via pip or pip3 (only support for python>=3.5)
pip3 install .
```

## Usage

Usage of `DeepCox`, `EfnBoost`, `BecCox` and `HitBoost` are provided in [Jupyter Notebooks](examples/).

Hyper-parameters tuning can refer to [libsurv/bysopt](bysopt/).

## Computation acceleration

As the objective function gradients are computed using `numpy` package, the model fitting round would be much slow and need to be optimized.

User can use `pytorch` to finish array or matrix computation instead of `numpy`. Furthermore, you can benefit from the power of GPUs. What is not acceptable is that you need to implement it yourself.
